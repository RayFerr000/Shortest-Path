If you are given some complete graph with n vertices inside a GUI window, find the shortest path between two user mouse clicks that does not intersect with any of the edges of the graph. I used Floyds algorithm to find the shortest path. An EXACT solution is provided however, when n is even moderately big, this algorithm chokes.
